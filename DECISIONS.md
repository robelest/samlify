- Decision: Follow `docs/EDGE_RUNTIME_PARITY_PLAN.md` milestone sequence M0 -> M11.
- Rejected alternatives:
  - Jump directly to cryptography rewrite without formal compatibility/security contracts.
  - Mixed architecture + runtime rewrite in one milestone.
- Expected impact:
  - Lower regression risk.
  - Clear acceptance gates for each phase.

## DEC-0002

- Date: 2026-02-16

- Rejected alternatives:
  - Breaking API rewrite in place.
  - Introduce new package name before parity.
- Expected impact:
  - Safer migration path with minimal consumer breakage.

## DEC-0003

- Date: 2026-02-16
- Context: Runtime code currently imports Node builtins (`fs`, `url`) and Node-centric crypto libraries.
- Decision: Runtime packages MUST not depend on Node builtins; replace Node-specific crypto/signature/encryption with edge-safe modules and adapters.
- Rejected alternatives:
  - Polyfill-first strategy as permanent architecture.
  - Keep Node-only fallback logic in core runtime packages.
- Expected impact:
  - True edge-runtime compatibility.
  - Better portability and deterministic runtime behavior.

## DEC-0004

- Date: 2026-02-16
- Context: Current repository is single-package; planned architecture requires multiple packages.
- Decision: Convert to Bun workspace in M1 with package boundaries and no behavior changes in that milestone.
- Rejected alternatives:
  - Keep monolith and refactor internals in-place.
  - Convert to workspace while changing crypto behavior simultaneously.
- Expected impact:
  - Cleaner ownership boundaries.
  - Easier testing and phased replacement.

## DEC-0005

- Date: 2026-02-16
- Context: Security-critical behavior must be explicit before implementation churn.
- Decision: Treat `COMPATIBILITY_SPEC.md` and `SECURITY_REQUIREMENTS.md` as mandatory merge preconditions for M0 completion.
- Rejected alternatives:
  - Defer contracts until after first implementation pass.
- Expected impact:
  - Prevents ambiguous behavior drift.
  - Improves agent/human handoff quality.

## DEC-0006

- Date: 2026-02-16
- Context: Repository needed immediate monorepo shape to start M1 package boundary work.
- Decision: Initialize Bun workspace at root with `workspaces: ["packages/*"]` and scaffold package directories for planned modules.

  - Keep single-package layout until crypto rewrite starts.
  - Introduce partial workspace with only one package.
- Expected impact:
  - Enables incremental package extraction without API breakage.
  - Unblocks workspace-based tooling and CI guardrails.

## DEC-0007

- Date: 2026-02-16

- Decision: Pin Bun install linker mode in `bunfig.toml` to `hoisted` during migration.
- Rejected alternatives:
  - Rely on Bun implicit linker defaults.
  - Switch immediately to isolated linker during initial extraction.
- Expected impact:
  - More predictable dependency layout for transition period.
  - Lower disruption while root package remains active.

## DEC-0008

- Date: 2026-02-16
- Context: M1 required first package-boundary extraction without changing public behavior.
- Decision: Route root `index.ts` through `packages/samlify/src/index.ts` and expose `extractor`/context APIs through `packages/core-xml` wrappers initially.
- Rejected alternatives:
  - Directly moving source files out of `src/` in the first extraction step.
  - Keeping root index as implementation source while deferring facade switch.
- Expected impact:
  - Early validation of workspace package boundaries.
  - Minimal risk by retaining existing implementation files in place during first cut.

## DEC-0009

- Context: Needed to progress M1 from wrappers to actual package ownership for XML extraction/context logic while preserving import compatibility.
- Decision: Move `api` and `extractor` implementations into `packages/core-xml/src` and keep `src/api.ts` + `src/extractor.ts` as re-export shims.
- Rejected alternatives:
  - Keep wrappers permanently and defer implementation move.
  - Move implementation and remove `src/*` entrypoints in the same step.
- Expected impact:
  - Real package boundary ownership starts in M1.
  - Existing imports used by tests and consumers continue working unchanged.

## DEC-0010

- Date: 2026-02-16
- Context: Needed to continue M1 extraction with low-risk module moves that preserve public behavior.
- Decision: Move `utility` to `packages/compat`, `validator` to `packages/security`, and `urn` + `types` to `packages/samlify`, leaving `src/*` compatibility shims in place.
- Rejected alternatives:
  - Delay these moves until larger runtime module extraction.
  - Move modules and remove compatibility shims in a single step.
- Expected impact:

- Expected impact:
  - Expands package ownership without introducing behavior changes.
  - Keeps current imports stable for tests and downstream consumers.

## DEC-0013

- Date: 2026-02-16
- Context: `compat` package is intended to host legacy/node-specific compatibility logic, while runtime packages must remain builtin-free.
- Decision: Scope forbidden-import guardrail to runtime packages only (`samlify`, `core-xml`, `c14n`, `xmldsig-edge`, `xmlenc-edge`, `security`) and exclude `compat`/`test-vectors`.
- Rejected alternatives:
  - Apply Node builtin ban to all workspace packages uniformly.
- Expected impact:
  - Preserves strict runtime constraints.
  - Allows controlled compatibility-layer code during migration.

## DEC-0014

- Date: 2026-02-16
- Context: Core SAML flow and binding modules were still rooted in `src`, limiting workspace package ownership.
- Decision: Move `binding-post`, `binding-redirect`, `binding-simplesign`, and `flow` implementations into `packages/samlify/src` and keep `src/*` shims for compatibility.

- Expected impact:
  - Improves internal consistency of package-owned entity stack.
  - Preserves existing tests and import compatibility.

## DEC-0017

- Date: 2026-02-16
- Context: `samlify` package modules still imported `src/libsaml.ts` directly, increasing coupling to root source tree.
- Decision: Introduce `packages/compat/src/libsaml.ts` wrapper and route package-level imports through that compat module.
- Rejected alternatives:
  - Move full `libsaml` implementation immediately in same phase.
  - Keep direct imports from root `src/libsaml.ts` indefinitely.
- Expected impact:
  - Reduces root-source coupling for extracted package modules.

  - Keep a mixed model with some implementation left in `src`.
- Expected impact:
  - Stable compatibility layer for existing imports.
  - Cleaner future migration path for runtime package hardening.

## DEC-0020

- Date: 2026-02-16
- Context: Workspace modules still referenced other packages through source-relative paths (`../../.../src`), which weakens package boundaries and complicates Bun workspace management.

- Rejected alternatives:
  - Keep duplicated semver ranges in each package.
  - Use custom version-sync scripts.
- Expected impact:
  - Single-source version management.
  - Lower drift risk during migration.

## DEC-0022

- Date: 2026-02-16
- Context: Static `fs` imports in compat code force Node builtin resolution at module load time and conflict with edge portability goals.
- Decision: Remove static `fs` imports from compat modules and resolve filesystem support only at runtime when file-path compatibility branches (`keyFile`, `exportMetadata`) are actually used.
- Rejected alternatives:
  - Keep static `fs` imports until full compat deprecation.
  - Drop file-path compatibility branches immediately.
- Expected impact:
  - Better edge portability for default in-memory code paths.
  - Preserved backward compatibility for Node-based file-path usage.

## DEC-0023

- Date: 2026-02-16
- Context: `@samlify/xmldsig-edge` was still carrying `node-rsa`, which violates runtime-package replacement goals for M3.

- Expected impact:
  - Smaller dependency surface.
  - Stable metadata output parity with existing tests.

## DEC-0026

- Date: 2026-02-16
- Context: Full flow test suite was blocked locally by Java runtime requirement from XSD validator package.
- Decision: Use a basic well-formed XML validator in flow tests so end-to-end test execution remains available without Java.
- Rejected alternatives:
  - Keep Java-dependent validator in default local test path.
  - Skip flow tests when Java is unavailable.
- Expected impact:
  - Full test suite runs in constrained/edge-oriented environments.
  - Flow behavior regressions remain detectable without external Java tooling.

## DEC-0027

- Date: 2026-02-16
- Context: `xml-crypto` usage remained duplicated across compat and xmldsig-edge layers.
- Decision: Keep `xml-crypto` usage centralized in `@samlify/xmldsig-edge` and remove direct compat-layer dependency by exposing signed-xml factory through xmldsig-edge.
- Rejected alternatives:
  - Keep duplicate `xml-crypto` imports in both layers.
  - Move full XMLDSig rewrite into same change.
- Expected impact:
  - Smaller compatibility layer dependency surface.

  - Move compression to async Web Streams APIs and change current sync helper surface.
- Expected impact:
  - Keeps existing sync behavior while reducing dependency surface.
  - Better alignment with edge-friendly pure JS runtime utilities.

## DEC-0029

- Date: 2026-02-16
- Context: `xpath` dependency remained in runtime package code and blocked dependency cleanup.
- Decision: Replace `xpath` usage with `fontoxpath` via a centralized `selectXPath` wrapper in `packages/core-xml/src/xpath.ts`.
- Rejected alternatives:
  - Keep direct `xpath` imports in runtime code.
  - Rewrite all extractor/signature selectors in one large custom traversal refactor.
- Expected impact:
  - Selector behavior remains centralized and test-covered.
  - Runtime dependency graph is reduced to edge-focused XML primitives.

## DEC-0030

- Date: 2026-02-16
- Context: Remaining edge-gap report blockers were static imports of parser/signature/encryption engines.
- Decision: Load DOM/XMLDSig/XML encryption engines through runtime adapter boundaries instead of static imports (`core-xml/api`, `xmldsig-edge`, `xmlenc-edge`).
- Rejected alternatives:
  - Keep static imports and rely on environment-specific bundler behavior.
  - Attempt full cryptographic engine rewrite in one change-set.
- Expected impact:
  - Gap report reaches zero tracked blockers while preserving current behavior.
